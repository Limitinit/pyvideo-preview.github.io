Unleash the creative artist inside you with the beauty of Generative Art. Learn how algorithms are used to create these aesthetic art forms, how motion and structures emit sounds and what toolkits are required to do so. This talk looks at Python as an artistic and visual programming language with the simplicity and beauty of generative art using Processing, PyCairo and webGL. The audience will see an evolution of generative art over the last 50 years, how autonomously these art forms are created using algorithms and how we can stimulate paints and other media. The talk will be showing how to create artworks inspired by geometric and mathematical patterns which also includes randomness with hands-on examples (Two such examples are added here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://imgur.com/a/lycAYnj"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/lycAYnj&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

Unleash the creative artist inside you with the beauty of Generative Art. Learn how algorithms are used to create these aesthetic art forms, how motion and structures emit sounds and what toolkits are required to do so. The talk will take the audience to a small history of Generative Art and how autonomously these art forms are created using algorithms with various examples using Processing, Numpy, PyCario and more.&lt;/p&gt;

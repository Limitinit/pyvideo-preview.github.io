&lt;p&gt;Applications and libraries with a pluggable architecture allow developers to add custom functionality. Plugins can customize user interfaces, create new workflows, and interface with legacy systems. Designing a plugin is often difficult - documentation is sparse, outdated, or non-existent. You end up diving into a unfamiliar codebase to figure out what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk examines Pluggable Architecture by creating a custom plugin system: we will design an interface, think about where to hook in custom behavior, and discuss testing techniques. Understanding these principles will enable us to write custom plugins for third-party libraries. Extend the functionality of your favourite library without touching existing code!&lt;/p&gt;

However, when we want to deploy our work into production, we need to extract the model from the notebook and package it up with the required artifacts (data, dependencies, configurations, etc) to ensure it works in other environments. Containerization technologies such as Docker can be used to streamline this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hands-on tutorial presents Docker in the context of Reproducible Data Science - from idea to application deployment. You will get a thorough introduction to the world of containers; learn how to incorporate Docker into various Data Science projects; and walk through the process of building a Machine Learning model in Jupyter and deploying it as a containerized Flask REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

conditional logic. Overusing conditionals results in code that is hard
to understand and difficult to modify. This talk will demonstrate how to
refactor &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements into polymorphic classes, resulting in
cleaner program design. After this session, you will be able to
implement complex conditional logic using simple Python classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing software is about making trade-offs between getting things done
and doing them right. Time constraints often force us to take shortcuts
to handle slight variations resulting in patches of conditional logic
sprinkled throughout our codebase. Workarounds that once allowed us to
move quickly now hinder our progress in getting new features out to
customers. It doesn't have to be this way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will demonstrate how to use Object-Oriented programming
patterns, specifically polymorphism, to handle conditional logic
resulting in code that is easy to modify. The material will be presented
in the context of a real- world code refactor for an open-source
project. We will examine the initial solution, discuss its limitations,
and walk through the process of refactoring nested &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; blocks into
polymorphic classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is geared towards developers who do not have a lot of
experience implementing Object-Oriented solutions. After this talk, you
will be able to identify situations where Object-Oriented design can be
used to simplify complex conditional logic. Using the steps outlined,
you will be able to refactor code to improve software architecture
without changing existing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

However, these benefits arenâ€™t free; we need to have a plan to write our app and to test it. This talk will introduce concepts and techniques that can be used to write effective tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) has over 175 managed services: from leveraging S3 as a storage bucket to developing voice-enabled applications with Alexa, developers can solve complex problems with a few API calls. You pay Amazon a little more and you ship products a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question isn't should you use managed services, but how best to bring them into your organization's existing processes and workflows. You probably already have one, or more than one, AWS account to support different development environments. Setting up new resources for each team/developer to test against is going to be a lot of work related to IAM roles, policies, and permissions. Also, API calls are not free; development and testing workflows that use AWS resources cost money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter LocalStack. LocalStack is a testing framework used to develop cloud-native applications. Start a container and write code against a local environment that has the same functionality and APIs as AWS! This talk will discuss how to integrate LocalStack into your project by demonstrating several basic and advanced workflows. The session is geared towards intermediate and advanced developers that use AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

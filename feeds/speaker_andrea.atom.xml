It is specifically targeted toward attendees who may be familiar with the concepts of DL, but want practical experience. Familiarity with Python and typical ML packages (e.g. pandas, numpy, sklearn) is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this session, you will understand how to:
Build some common DL architectures in PyTorch
Evaluate and improve the performance
Take advantage of more compute (and when you should do so)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will set you up to take advantage of interesting developments in the field and maybe even contribute your own!&lt;/p&gt;

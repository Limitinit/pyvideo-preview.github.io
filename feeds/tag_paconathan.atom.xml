While these might seem to require special platforms and specialized expertise, in fact there's so much that can be done with graph-based technologies in Python. A team of open source developers has been working on [`kglab`](https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab) to integrate many different libraries related to graph work into an abstraction that plays well with popular data science tools in Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Parquet, spaCy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc. This session will introduce _Graph Data Science_, showing how you can leverage these techniques into your data analytics work.

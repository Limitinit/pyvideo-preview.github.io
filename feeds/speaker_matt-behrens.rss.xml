library for controlling the Asterisk telephony engine. Watch what's
going on inside Asterisk, answer the phone with &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;, ring
phones, and present an interactive phone menu, connecting up to just

the mid-00s. In this talk, you'll learn about the tools I found to
modernize development, installation, and isolation as well as the
libraries that make building CLIs and working with the OS easy. We'll
cover Pipenv and how best to use it with setuptools, as well as Click
and other libraries useful for this task.&lt;/p&gt;

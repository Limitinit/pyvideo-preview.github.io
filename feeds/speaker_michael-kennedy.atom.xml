Gone are the days where simply knowing one technology really really well is sufficient to stay on the cutting edge. We are expected to write web-based applications, mobile applications, cross-platform applications and so on. Even as we know we should learn more and branch out, that choice is increasingly difficult as the technology options explode.
This talk will give you one very solid choice that is familiar to .NET developers: Python. It may seem like a very different language and ecosystem when compared to .NET but just below the surface, there are many more similarities than there are differences. For .NET's Entity Framework, Python has SQLAlchemy. For .NET's ASP.NET MVC, Python has The Pyramid Web Framework. The list goes on and on.
Come learn why your team should learn Python as a complementary language to .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever wanted to learn more about some of your favorite technical podcasts? Join this interactive session to hear from popular podcast hosts Michael Kennedy (Talk Python to Me), Brian Okken (Test &amp;amp; Code). Theyâ€™ll share how they got started, stories about notable guests, and maybe even some tips &amp;amp; tricks for starting your own podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.&lt;/p&gt;

mean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important
pythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional
Python code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into
more an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its
users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you new to running web apps in production? Do you have that nagging feeling that you should improve the ways you structure, deploy, and develop your app? Want to see some lessons learned from running a group of Pyramid web apps on a cluster of Linux servers? Join the talk as Michael Kennedy, founder of Talk Python, as he shares his top 10 list of lessons learned running a variety of web apps over the past 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is open to all frameworks. Whether you use Pyramid, Flask, or Django, most of the tips and tricks will apply to your web apps you're building and deploying today.&lt;/p&gt;

Python's memory story is not often told. We hear it uses reference counting and that's about the end of it. But there is so much more going on. There is also a GC backing up reference counting, why? Instagram turned theirs off and got faster, how? Python classes can be memory hogs. But there is an escape hatch that is almost always available to us which uses much less memory and is faster computationally. Yet, almost no one opens it. You might want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Michael Kennedy from Talk Python Training and look at how Python memory works and design patterns for functions and classes making Python more efficient (memory-wise) and get a solid speed boost as a side benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discovering that many major cities in the United States have open data projects that allow for a level of transparency. I was happy to discover that my own city had data available but quickly realized that the data had many issues that would make it difficult to analyze as-is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how I was able to consolidate &amp;quot;Calls for Service&amp;quot; to the San Diego Police Department since 2015. This was done by importing the city-provided CSV files into Pandas DataFrames and making modifications to standardize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also convert approximate location data to a geo_point using Public geoJSON data and the filter capabilities in Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I will show how you can bulk upload the data into and out of Elasticsearch via eland so that it can be visualized in Kibana or a public graphing platform and how I automated this process to check for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.&lt;/p&gt;

delayed. Some of the most obscure data comes from reporting from local,
state and federal governments. That said the data is there, freely available
and it has to be provided in a consistent (at some level) manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at how I made Police Call Records easier to investigate with
Python, Pandas and Eland.&lt;/p&gt;

Elastic has an ecosystem of products that to tell a story around both internal and external data. Companies use the Elastic Stack to gain insight on websites, businesses, and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversityorgs.tech allows guests to search for diversity-focused orgs in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at web traffic and examine trends in orgs searched. I'll explain ingesting that data from NGINX logs using Beats. We’ll look at analytics from Elastic App Search and visualize this information with Kibana. Finally, we'll use that information to implement a new feature giving people requests based on their perceived area, ALL WHILE REQUIRING NO COOKIES OR TRACKING FROM OUR USERS.&lt;/p&gt;

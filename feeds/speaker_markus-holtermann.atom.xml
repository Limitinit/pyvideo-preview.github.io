User name + password is the most common one. OAuth with Facebook / Github / Google / Twitter is also common. But sometimes you can't rely on 3rd party services and user name + password is not enough. In those cases 2 Factor Authentication is a nice, additional security layer. Use e.g. a phone to ensure a more secure authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're tasked with building a search for the project you're working on. But where do you start? What search implementation are you going to use? There's a sheer unlimited set of ways to implement &amp;quot;I'm looking for X in Y&amp;quot; out there.

&lt;p&gt;“A Pony On The Move: How Migrations Work In Django 🐎” by Markus Holtermann&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django ships with a built-in migration framework since version 1.7 in 2014. While migrations are widely used by almost every Django project ever since, there is little known about the internals of the migration framework. This talk will look into its components and how they are tied together.&lt;/p&gt;

And it works tremendously. But that’s only on the surface. Whenever you deploy your code and apply migrations in production, you are about to enter dangerous territory. I will point out common pitfalls and show you ways to avoid them. And with some additional best practices at hand, you will be ready for your next production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

And despite all the testing we do, some operations and interactions with these services will not work out the way we expect or hope. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to reconstruct what led to a problem? And then analyze if the same problem occurred at other times?
In this talk, I want to look at structured logging. What are the benefits of it over plain-text logging? How can it be used effectively?
Logging, by itself, can help to trace bugs. Structured logging adds additional, post-logging capabilities when used correctly. Because log events are structured data, they can be analyzed much more efficiently and effectively than plain text log messages. Furthermore, one can even build graphs and diagrams to visualize what’s happening in a service nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of not only websites but many other services as well has risen tremendously. The Let’s Encrypt organization and certificate authority (CA) makes that pretty easy. Since September 2015 almost 1.8 million certificates have been issued. And you can use it, too. For free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll demonstrate how to integrate SSL/TLS and point out some common pitfalls. I’ll briefly layout the Let's Encrypt ACME protocol and explain what you need to set up in Django to make SSL/TLS the default and only way to access your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of technology and engineering where almost everything around us requires software. Unfortunately, the software we use or build has bugs. While most bugs can &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; be fixed, there are these other types of bugs, called vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can be found in our own infrastructure, on customers' infrastructure, or — worse — around user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we see reports of leaked personal data on a daily basis. And when it comes to the companies who just had data leaked, it is astounding how rattled and unprepared they are for the situation. In fact, a lot of companies are puzzled when someone external approaches them about a possible security issue publicly. They don't know how to react and often react in the worst possible way: denial. But it is also about issues that are found from within the company. Issues that may not directly affect personal information. There is more to do than telling customers there is a security release of some software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT security is a sheer endless topic to talk about. It is a mindset and a company culture that must be lived by each and everyone within a company. In this talk, I will point out what roles individual departments play. Because there are more questions to be answered than “how and when are customers informed about an issue and a corresponding solution”. Are details about the issue released, and if so, when, and will the details be released publicly or only to customers? How will a public outcry about an issue on social media be dealt with? Is the social media team equipped to handle the masses? Will the sales and marketing teams be able to handle a hesitant customers base? What legal implications does the issue have? Who coordinates, makes decisions, and stays on top all of these moving parts?&lt;/p&gt;

And despite all the testing we do, some interactions with these services will not work out the way we hope. Wouldn’t it be great to reconstruct what let to a problem and analyze if the problem occurred at other times?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever thought about what happens when somebody finds a security issue in Django? How does one responsibly disclose the issue? What happens after that? How does the Django team work on it? What happens until a Django security release is published? What comes afterwards?
Also, Django is “reassuringly secure”. Let’s look at the history ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll give an insight on how the Django team handles security issues,
which can serve as a guideline and followed in own projects. We'll
will also review the history of Django's security issues to identify
hotspots and areas to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

Hence, it's not a question that you should be able to define them through Django. While you're already kind of able to do that with &lt;cite&gt;dbindex=true&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;index_together&lt;/cite&gt;, these options are rather limiting. Django 1.11 comes with a new feature to allow you to express your index requirements much more granular.&lt;/p&gt;

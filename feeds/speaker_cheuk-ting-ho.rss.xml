problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data.
Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is
very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may
compare them character by character and have an idea of how many
characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most
application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and
therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is
never straight forward though, the definition of how “difference” of two
names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant
names, matching of words like “cafe” “bar” and “restaurant” are consider
less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we
consider company names that matches partly (like “Happy Unicorn company”
and Happy Unicorn co.”) are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the
similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions
in Fuzzywuzzy like “partial &lt;em&gt;ratio” and “token&lt;/em&gt; sort_ratio” will also
be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to
understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the
second half, we will start tackling the example problem: matching
company names, we will show that besides using Fuzzywuzzy, we have to
also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and
speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all
tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how
efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like
to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar
problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be
explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start, we will be using &lt;cite&gt;dir&lt;/cite&gt; to look into the secret functions Python objects have. Eg:
&lt;cite&gt;__getitem__&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;__iter__&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;__next__&lt;/cite&gt; Then, we will investigate where is the dunder function goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how dunder functions can change the identity of the Python objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for attendees who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining the dunder functions and the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better understanding of why Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages. Hopefully, this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

Intelligence, people hope to get information out of the structure of an
organization or a communication network. In this talk, we use the hotel
room search requests from travel agents, including online public
website, B2C, B2B and B2B2C, to build a relational network among them.
By using this network as an example, we demonstrate how insights can be
extract by studying network properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the talk, we will explain how the network is built
using NetworkX, an open-source python library that is designed for the
creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and
functions of complex networks. When 2 agents are making the same search
at the same time , a link ( or an “edge” in network analysts terms) is
made pointing form the initial searcher to the subsequent searcher.
Using a list of these searches, a directed graph is built. We will also
demonstrate how to pick the biggest connected component out form the
graph. In the second half, with the graphs created, we show how
different functions of NetworkX can be used to study the graphs. By
compare the graph properties of our graph to the other popular network
graphs, we can get the insight of how the network was created. Also by
studying the graphs, we can understand the behavior of the agents and
can even figure out which agents are acting as main hubs in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people who are interested in network analysis and would
like to see how it can be used in a business case. Audiences with any
level of python experience can learn some basic concept of network
analysis work and how it can be applied to provide business insights.&lt;/p&gt;

As protesters are mainly young, educated and technology-aware people, they are trying to use the new technology to outwit the government which also use AI and technology to control its people. Who got the upper hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever think about using Tinder to look for a ‘date’ in the protest? Or using Uber to call for a free ride to drive you to safety?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk, we will cover the background of the protest, why it happened and how it is started. We will briefly talk about the politic environment of Hong Kong and what causes the protest 1: the fear of losing a “high degree of autonomy”
In the second part, which is the main part of the talk, we will cover how technology/ apps like Telegram, Tinder, Pokemon Go, Twitch, AirDrop, Bridgefy, Uber, etc were used in by the protesters and what
role they play in the protest. People use Telegram’s encryption to communicate without worrying leaking of identity; they use Tinder to spread the news about where and when to protest; They use Pokemon Go
to gather people 4; AirDrop to spread the message to the Chinese tourists; Bridgefy to communicate where internet is not available at crowded areas 3; Uber to let the protested know where there are
volunteer drivers to take you to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third part, we will have a look at what technology the Chinese government may use to tighten its grip over Hong Kong. One of the front lines of the protest in the online activism 5, the Chinese
government has it’s own ‘50 cent army’ which is also known as ‘China bots’ who were paid to leave pro-CCP comments on social media. Which eventually cause Twitter and Facebook to shout down lots of accounts. Also, there are attacks cyberattacks, suspected to be related to the protest, towards Telegram and an online forum LiHKG which the protesters used to communicate. It is also suspected that the
government installed ‘smart’ lamppost which use facial detection to monitor the citizen of Hong Kong after protested found parts made by a Shanghai company which also made the surveillance cameras in mainland China 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for audients who are interested to know how our lives are changed by technology and how they could influence our society. By the end of the talk, audients will be more aware of what consequence new technology may bring us and be more thoughtful about the ethics behind the implementation of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will use a task: hiring a GPU on Google Cloud Platform to train neural network, as an example to show how an application can be deployed on a cloud platform with Docker and Terraform. The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a Google Compute Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people with no experience in application deployment on cloud service but would benefit form computational reproducibility and cloud service, potentially data scientists/ analysts or tech practitioners who didn't have a software developing background. We will use an example that is simple but useful in data science to demonstrate basic usage of Docker and Terraform which would be beneficial to beginners who would like to simplify their work flow with those tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how many times you look up “how to do this in pandas”? Though it is the most popular data handling library in Python, it is quite complicated due to the rigidness of storing data in tabular formats. This is most obvious when the data stored is imported from a JSON file and end up having multiple layers of objects. At this point, you wished for a data structure that let you store data with objects and subclasses, just like in object-orientated programs. The answer? Semantic knowledge graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Cheuk will first introduce what is semantic knowledge graphs. It’s building block: triples, and how all data can be described will them - with objects and properties. Cheuk will assume no prior knowledge and will explain via examples and visualization with the TerminusDB model builder - a graphical interface that allows you to build schemas for semantic knowledge graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next part, Cheuk will show how to construct a schema based on a pandas DataFrame. With the Python client of TemrinusDB, schema can be built programmatically follow by importing the data in the DataFrame. In this part, basic Python knowledge is assumed. In this part, Cheuk will show the internals of pandas, dissecting it and reconstruct a knowledge graph schema. Cheuk will also show the code that transforms the data and insert them in the prepared graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cheuk will visualize the graph in a customized interactive graph visualization in Jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies, could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the community better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

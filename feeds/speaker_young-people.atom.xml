&lt;p&gt;“Digitisation and Education — How the AlekSIS project fosters co-creation of school software by young people” by Dominik George, Tom Teichler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free software is all about participation, and projects can empower young people to participate by designing their software in a way that opens it up for learning and teaching in education. This talk reports from the AlekSIS project that develops real-world educational software that is intended to be extended by the students that actually work with it.&lt;/p&gt;

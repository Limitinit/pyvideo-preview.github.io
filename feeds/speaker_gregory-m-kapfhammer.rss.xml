This presentation will explain how to use these technologies and platforms to teach interdisciplinary and introductory courses in computer programming and software engineering. This presentation will first show how to create a GitHub organization connected to a GitHub Classroom with unlimited private repositories that contain instructor solutions and starter kits and assignment submissions for both individual and team-based programming assignments. The talk will next explain how to connect GitHub repositories to continuous integration servers hosted by Travis CI, thus supporting the cloud-based execution of tests and checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will subsequently introduce a Python program, called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gkapfham/gatorgrader"&gt;GatorGrader&lt;/a&gt;, that supports the local and cloud-based checking of a
student’s source code and technical writing for a programming project.
GatorGrader can check, for example, that a submission contains the
required number of comments and produces the correct number of lines of
console output. Suitable for use on either a local workstation or a
cloud-based server provided by Travis CI, GatorGrader can, for instance,
ensure that a student makes the requisite number of commits to a GitHub
repository and structures a program in a specified fashion. GatorGrader
can also invoke external programs that ensure the quality of a student’s
technical writing. Finally, since most of the aforementioned assignments
are designed to be completed in teams, this presentation introduces
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GatorGrouper/gatorgrouper"&gt;GatorGrouper&lt;/a&gt;, another Python program that uses student responses on a
Google Form to create suitable groups of students who collaboratively
complete programming projects with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

Suitable for both full-time educators and members of industry who educate their colleagues, this presentation will explain how to use these technologies and platforms to teach interdisciplinary and introductory courses in computer programming and software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will first show how to create a GitHub organization connected to a GitHub Classroom with unlimited private repositories that contain instructor solutions and starter kits and submissions from both individual and team-based assignments. The talk will next explain how to connect GitHub repositories to continuous integration servers hosted by Travis CI, thus supporting the cloud-based execution of tests and checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will subsequently introduce the design and implementation of and the testing strategy for a Python program that supports the local and cloud-based checking of the source code and technical writing for a project. Designed to complement the automated checks performed by a test suite, this tool, called [GatorGrader](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader"&gt;https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader&lt;/a&gt;), can verify that a submission contains the required number of comments and produces the correct number of lines of console output. It can also, for instance, ensure that a student makes the requisite number of commits to a GitHub repository and implements a program in a specified fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, people who attend this talk will learn more about how to use platforms like GitHub and Travis CI, open-source Python packages, and Python programming language features to effectively deliver instructional materials and assess assignment submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

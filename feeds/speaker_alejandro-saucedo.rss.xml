throughout my career building &amp;amp; deploying machine learning systems in
critical environments across several sectors. I will provide a deep dive
on how to build scalable and distributed machine learning data pipelines
using Airflow with a Celery backend. I will also compare Airflow with
other technologies available out there and how it differentiates, such
as Luigi, Chronos, Pinball, etc. If you attend the talk, you will obtain
an understanding on the solid fundamentals of Airflow, together with its
caveats and walk-arounds for more complex use-cases. As we proceed with
the examples, I will cover the challenges that you will run into when
scaling Machine Learning systems, and how Airflow can be used to address
these using a manager-worker-queue architecture for distributed
processing with Celery. By the end of this talk you will have the
knowledge required to build your own industry-ready machine learning
pipelines to process data at scale, and I will provide further reading
resources so people are able to implement the knowledge obtained almost
right away.&lt;/p&gt;

the productization of machine learning systems, including concepts such
as reproducibility, explainability and orchestration. The talk will also
provide a high level overview of several key open source tools and
frameworks available to tackle these issues, which have been identifyed
putting together the Awesome Machine Learning Operations list
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-machine-learning-operations"&gt;https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-machine-learning-operations&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The key concepts that will be covered are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Reproducibility&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Explainability&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Orchestration of models&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reproducibility piece will cover key motivations as well as
practical requirements for model versioning, together with tools that
allow data scientists to achieve version control of model+config+data to
ensure full model lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explainability piece will contain a high level overview of why this
has become an important topic in machine learning, including the high
profile incidents that tech companies have experienced where undesired
biases have slipped into data. This will also include a high level
overview of some of the tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the orchestration piece will cover some of the fundamental
challenges with large scale serving of models, together with some of the
key tools that are available to ensure this challenge can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the impact of software increasingly reaches farther and wider, our professional responsibility as developers becomes more critical to society. The production systems we design, build and maintain often bring inherent adversities with complex technical, societal and even ethical challenges. The skillsets required to tackle these challenges require us to go beyond the algorithms, and require cross-functional collaboration that often goes beyond a single developer. In this talk we introduce intuitive and practical insights from a few of the core ethics themes in software including Privacy, Equity, Trust and Transparency. We cover their importance, the growing societal challenges, and how organisations such as The Institute for Ethical AI, The Linux Foundation, the Association for Computer Machinery, NumFocus, the IEEE and the Python Software Foundation are contributing to these critical themes through standards, policy advise and open source software initiatives. We finally will wrap up the talk with practical steps that any individual can take to get involved and contribute to some of these great open initiatives, and contribute to these critical ongoing discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a practical insight on how to build scalable data streaming machine learning pipelines to process large datasets in real time using Python and popular frameworks such as Kafka, SpaCy and Seldon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be covering a case study performing automated content moderation on Reddit comments in real time. Our dataset will consist of 200k reddit comments from /r/science, 50,000 of which have been removed by moderators. We will be handling the stream data in a Kubernetes cluster, and the stream processing will be handled using the stream processing library Kafka. We will be running the end-to-end pipeline in Kubernetes with various components legeraging SKLearn, SpaCy and Seldon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then dive into fundamental concepts on stream processing such as windows, watermarking and checkponting, and we will show how to use each of these frameworks to build complex data streaming pipelines that can perform real time processing at scale by building, deploying and monitoring a machine learning model which will process production incoming data..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we will show best practices when using these frameworks, as well as a high level overview of tools that can be used for monitoring in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track: PyData: Machine Learning &amp;amp; Stats
As data science capabilities scale, the core concept of security becomes growingly critical. In this talk we will introduce the security challenges and solutions for data science practitioners relevant to each of the phases of the machine learning lifecycle, and we will provide a practical set of best practices and frameworks that can be adopted to ensure a relevant level of security is present in the multiple stages of the machine learning lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

All the leading
search engine exploit knowledge graph to provide more accurate result to
user, e.g. Bing, Google, Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, the speaker will demonstrate how to build a searchable
knowledge graph from scratch. Lots of python tools will be applied
during the process. The process includes data wrangling, graph entity
indexing, full text search and web visualization. The data sources are
from dbpedia.org. Enormous amount of entities are collected and stored
to graph database for relationship querying and full text search engine
for searching. In the web visualization, a searchable interface and
visualized result demonstrate the knowledgable information to customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lai is a Python fan, and his interested topics are natural
language processing and machine learning. He specializes in combining
machine learning algorithm and cloud computing technology to do big data
analysis, building application services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve efficiency issue of our Python application. We started with cProfile to profile function call CPU cost and found it couldn't differentiate call-stacks sharing the same function calls. Asyncio makes the issue worse, since gathered functions all have the event loop as caller. We ended up build our own function call profilers:
* CPU cost profiler: CPU instructions per function call with complete call stack.
* Latency profiler with asyncio support: collect timestamp/latency per function call and yield from await.
* Profiler identifies lru_cache opportunities: functions have high cost and high hit rate of parameters/returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share how we implemented those profilers. After this talk, you'll have learned how to:
* Build profilers by registering a callback function for function calls.
* Handle call stacks in asyncio world.
* Use different timers and traversing through call-stack.
* Implement a CPU profiler, latency profiler lru_cache opportunities profiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is flexible and allows us to implement the same function in different ways. Some ways are simpler, more efficient, or more secure than others and are preferred as coding conventions. We have a big codebase with hundreds of developers and thus coding convention is especially important to prevent bad patterns being copy-pasted and spread around. We started with building lint rules as Flake8 plugins and found limitations. We also wanted to be able to provide auto-fixes for lint violations. So we built Fixit.
Fixit is a lint framework that complements Flake8. It’s based on LibCST which makes it possible to provide auto-fixes. Lint rules are made easy to build through matcher pattern, test toolkit, utility helpers (e.g. scope analysis) for non-trivial boilerplate. It is optimized for efficiency, easy to customize and comes with many builtin lint rules. In this talk, you’ll learn our story of building Fixit and learn to use it in your project to help you write better Python code!&lt;/p&gt;

The web applications are vulnerable for various reasons including a) configuration settings of the web applications b) lack of implementation of security best practices and secure coding and c) lack of awareness of secure first web applications among developers. The vulnerable web applications put the data of the customers at greater risk and the compromised code can lead to problems beyond control. It is very important to develop secure web applications to protect customer data and code to mitigate the risk. In this talk, we will focus on two aspects. First, performing penetration testing on Django web applications to identify vulnerabilities and scanning for Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 risks. Second, strategies and configuration settings for making the source code and Django applications secure. We will also discuss the Djangohunter tool to identify incorrectly configured Django applications that are exposing sensitive information.

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from them you start running and look for a safe place to hide. On the way, you will find a good person and requests him to help you. He hides you in his place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit a good person’s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making them fall in the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk begins with an introduction to deception technology, deception types, and methods, a deceptive security life cycle. In this talk, we will demonstrate the following deception tools implemented using python language:
•       WebTrap (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap"&gt;https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap&lt;/a&gt;): is designed to create deceptive webpages to deceive and redirect attackers away from real websites. The deceptive webpages are generated by cloning real websites, specifically their login pages.
•       DemonHunter (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter"&gt;https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter&lt;/a&gt;):  is a distributed low interaction honeypot with Agent/Master design
Finally, we will conclude the talk with how built a deception tool and demonstrate its working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we implemented a deception tool in python using machine learning:
We designed a deception tool in python language using PyBRAIN package to model and mitigate XPath injection attacks for web services. It is known that XML can be used to store the data and this data can be queried using XPath query language. XPath is a query language, it has injection issues similar to SQL. To handle this issue, we proposed a solution, which uses a count-based validation technique and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modular neural networks to identify and classify atypical behavior in user input. Once the atypical user input is identified, the attacker is redirected to fake resources to protect the critical data. Our experiment resulted in over 90% accuracy in the classification of input vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session begins with a discussion on homomorphic properties of cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elgamal, Paillier, Elliptic Curve, and Gentry’s Cryptosystems with the demonstration. The session discusses techniques to reduce computational complexity. This session also discusses a case study on how machine learning techniques can be applied to encrypted data for secure computation and protecting the machine learning model. The talk will include the demonstration of the Python implementation of the RSA algorithm. To demonstrate the techniques to reduce complexity, we will perform multiplication over large random numbers using common * operator, multiplication using FFT, and Karatsuba algorithm. SciPy package has an in-built implementation for FFT. To demonstrate the implementation of secure machine learning model we used PyBRAIN and cryptography packages of python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber forensics is a field that deals with the investigation of digital crimes by analyzing, examining, identifying, and recovering digital evidence from electronic devices and producing them in the court of law. The talk begins with an introduction to digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application. The modules covered in the discussion are pyscreenshot, Whoosh, PIL, hashlib, mutagen, pyPDF2, and pefile. Finally, I will demonstrate creating small cyber forensic applications using bulit-in modules and functions that are already to known to most of the Python programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

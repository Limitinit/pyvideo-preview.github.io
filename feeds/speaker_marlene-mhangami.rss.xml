Despite the cancellations, the Python community has continued to meet, grow, and learn together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join this interactive session to learn from community organizers based in three counties: Zimbabwe, Indonesia, and South Korea to hear about how COVID has impacted their communities, and what they’ve done to continue to foster a local Python community in spite of quarantines and cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.&lt;/p&gt;

I will give a brief history of Python and parallel computing, take a look at Python’s ‘infamous’ GIL, and share how and why Pythonistas can get started with using GPUs to do more work faster.&lt;/p&gt;

organization and Python developers in the Harare software development
community to advance the cause of women in technology in Zimbabwe. The
program operates in community centers, universities, high schools and
tech hubs to make programming accessible to girls regardless of their
socio-economic status. Upon initially joining a ZimboPy club, many of
the girls would have never used a computer before, let alone code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zimbabwe, only 17% of computer science undergraduate majors are
women, and in the developing world, women make up less than 20% of the
information and technology workforce. ZimboPy exists to empower
Zimbabwean girls with the skills and confidence necessary to not only
enter the local tech industry, but to lead it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning to code, ZimboPy club members also join a global
network of women in technology that are working to tackle social
challenges through human-centered design and computer science. ZimboPy’s
mentorship program invites experienced women developers, mainly from the
United States and Europe, to help Zimbabwean girls address local
problems which can be solved with technology, such as clean water and
e-commerce solutions for small shops in towns and villages. Mentors will
travel to Zimbabwe and work with girls as they develop a plan for their
applications and pair-program with them, answering questions and
providing feedback along the way. To ensure that the girls are
successful, mentors will continue to work with their groups even after
leaving the country through weekly video conferences and email feedback.
Overall, ZimboPy looks forward to changing Zimbabwe’s future through
creativity, collaboration and the power of Python programming.&lt;/p&gt;

community has been a central part of our work. For our mentorship week
that was held in April we had python programmers from USA, Italy,
Australia and of course Zimbabwe join us in person and virtually. Our
talk will outline what we've achieved so far and how anyone who's part
of the Python community can get involved. We invite developers from
around the world to help Zimbabwean girls address local problems which

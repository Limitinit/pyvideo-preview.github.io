&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise why many of us are so enamored with Python. Its simplicity, accessibility, and community make it a prime choice for many projects. However, not all software engineering shops use Python, maybe even some of the jobs you work at. Introducing Python to your company and building a Pythonic culture from the ground up is no small task, but it can be done. Join me as I take you through the journey of getting Python from zero to hero within my previous company. I’ll share the experience from start to finish, including what worked, what didn’t, what I would have done differently, and how I evangelized Python to bring it to be a supported language within my company’s ecosystem. Viewers will leave having learned from my experiences—both successes and mistakes—and with a solid plan for implementing Python at their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project documentation is easy to neglect. Keep your docs inside your
source repo &amp;amp; learn how to automatically build &amp;amp; publish beautiful docs
on every commit. Viewers will leave with a new mindset on how to handle
documentation, tooling for this process, &amp;amp; an easy-to-implement method
to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common for developers to overlook the documentation of their
works. They are either on a time crunch, lack the proper tooling, or
simply just forget to create and update the documentation. Whatever the
cause behind this, it is not a proper excuse for not keeping the
documentation up to date. However, for all our development processes
there are few as neglected as the documentation process. Documentation
should be treated as important as the code that makes up the project.
So, let’s move the documentation into the code. With modern
documentation tools such as MkDocs and Sphinx, both of which are Python
powered tools, and Continuous Integration tools we can now include docs
in the commit. They can be reviewed in code reviews, built and versioned
in a CI tool, and even tested for things such as correct code examples
and broken links. This is the process that the developer knows,
understands, and enjoys. I introduced a team to this exact workflow and
a working pipeline; all they had to do was keep the documentation up to
date. This team currently has some of the most up to date documentation
in a company of near two thousand engineers, and they never complain
about writing/updating documentation. It’s just part of the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

documentation and the code works on the first run. Now think of all the
hours spent wasted following broken, outdated, or incomplete documentation.
From our favorite tutorials to bad product docs we all consume technical
writing. Tutorials, blog posts, and product docs help developers learn new
things, build projects, and debug issues. But what makes one tutorial better
than another? In this talk I'll discuss how you can write the documentation
that developers love and I’ll share 10 tips and tricks to improve your
technical writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was the year of forced remote work. People struggle with this change due to lack of guidance on how to manage this shift. Due to this, many people have developed a negative opinion of remote work. However, remote work can be liberating. So how can you make working remotely enjoyable? From daily routines to simulated commutes I’ll discuss strategies for making remote work comfortable, productive, and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

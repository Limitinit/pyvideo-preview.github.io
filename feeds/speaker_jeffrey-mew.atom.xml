Visual Studio Code now offers a first class Notebooks experience along with many great features for Data Scientists and Python developers alike. Come see how you can explore, experiment and productionize machine learning models using the flexibility of Notebooks combined with the power and productivity of VS Code. Along the way we’ll also be connecting to several Azure services from within VS Code, including Azure Virtual Machines for running the training job, Azure Storage for storing the dataset and model, Azure Functions for deploying our model and endpoint, and Azure Web Service for running a web application for making predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what breed that dog or cat is? Let’s build a pet detector
service to recognize them in pictures! In this talk, we will walk
through the training, optimizing, and deploying of a deep learning model
by using VS Code and the Azure Machine Learning service. We will use
transfer learning to recognize dog and cat breeds. Next, we’ll optimize
the model using Azure Machine Learning service to improve the model
accuracy. Putting on our developer hat, we'll then refactor the
notebooks into Python modules using VS Code. Finally, we will deploy the
model as a web service in Azure, all from the comforts of VS Code. Come
to see how Azure and VS Code makes AI and machine learning development
and deployment easy.&lt;/p&gt;

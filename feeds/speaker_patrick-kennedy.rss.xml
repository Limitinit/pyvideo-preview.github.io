Understanding how each context works is important when developing Flask applications, and yet they are often misunderstood. This talk dives into how the application and request contexts work when handling a request. The concept of proxies is discussed for providing thread-local access to the application and request contexts. To really illustrate how the application context works, pytest will be utilized to show how the application context works outside of a request. This example shows a common error ('Working outside of application context') during testing and how it should be solved by pushing to the application context stack.&lt;/p&gt;
